    <h2 id="chapter1">Career</h2>
        <p1>At the age of 24, Mugler moved to Paris. He began designing clothes for Parisian boutique, Gudule. At 26, Mugler, who was working as a freelance designer, began to design for a variety of large ready-to-wear fashion houses in Paris, Milan, London and Barcelona.</p1>
        <p1>In 1973, Mugler created his first personal collection called "Café de Paris". The style of the collection was both sophisticated and urban. Melka Tréanton, a powerful fashion editor, helped to launch his career. In 1976, she asked him to show his work in Tokyo for an event organized by Shiseido. In 1978, he opened his first Paris boutique at the Place des Victoires in the 1er Arrondissement. At the same time, Thierry Mugler launched a fashion collection for men.</p1>
    <h2 id="chapter2">Retirement from fashion</h2>
        <p1>Clarins shuttered the ready-to-wear component of Mugler's brand in 2003, due to financial losses; however, they kept the perfume division open as it was profitable. Mugler left fashion in 2002. When asked about the subject he has said: "Fashion is beautiful, 3-D art on a human being. But it wasn't enough, which is why I went on to create in other ways. For me, it wasn't the right tool anymore. But perfume still interests me".</p1>
    <h2 id="chapter3">Fragrances</h2>
        <p1>Mugler's first perfume appeared in 1992 and was called Angel. "Angel" contains a combination of praline and chocolate mixed with a strong accord of patchouli. It would be a part of a new fragrance type called gourmand. The Angel bottle, a design in the shape of a faceted star, was created by the Brosse Master Glassmakers. Fans of the fragrance include Diana Ross, Barbara Walters, Eva Mendes, and Hillary Clinton.</p1>
    <h2 id="chapter4">Personal life</h2>
    <p1>Mugler is openly gay, and is a longtime bodybuilder. Since his departure from fashion he has become notably reclusive. During this time he began going by his first name, Manfred, and began extensive bodybuilding. Speaking on the subject Thierry-Maxime Loriot said, "He told me that after he left the fashion industry, it annoyed him when people recognized him. He felt 'Thierry Mugler' was a label, a brand. He wanted to move on to other things.</p1>
